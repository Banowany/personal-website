            I am a fifth-year Computer Science student at Jagiellonian University.
            I have been fascinated by computers since childhood — I do not just want to use them, I want to understand how and why they work.

            These days, I feel most at home in web development, especially on the backend, though I can handle frontend work as well. I have spent the most time working with Java and C#, but I am also comfortable with Python.

            Curiosity drives me in everything I do. It is not enough for me to know that something works — I want to understand why. I am interested not only in building applications, but also in their deployment, infrastructure, and the processes that make them reliable and accessible.
